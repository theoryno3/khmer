Development miscellany
======================

Python command-line scripts should use '-' instead of '_' in the name.
(Only filenames containing code for import imported should use _.)

Please follow the command-line conventions used under scripts/.  This
includes most especially standardization of '-x' to be hash table size,
'-N' to be number of hash tables, and '-k' to always refer to the
k-mer size.

Command line thoughts:

   If a filename is required, typically UNIX commands don't use a flag to
   specify it.

   Also, positional arguments typically aren't used with multiple files.

   CTB's overall philosophy is that new files, with new names, should
   be created as the result of filtering etc.; this allows easy
   chaining of commands.  We're thinking about how best to allow
   override of this, e.g. ::

      filter-abund.py <kh file> <filename> [ -o <filename.keep> ]

All code in scripts/ must have automated tests; see tests/test_scripts.py.
Otherwise it belongs in sandbox/.

When files are overwritten, they should only be opened to be overwritten
after the input files have been shown to exist.  That prevents stupid
command like mistakes from trashing important files.

It would be nice to allow piping from one command to another where possible.
But this seems complicated.

CTB: should we squash output files (overwrite them if they exist), or not?
So far, leaning towards 'not', as that way no one is surprised and loses
their data.
